	\section*{Tests}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Test that with externalization, no picture is generated multiple times.
		\item Test that there are no warnings without using externalization.
		\item Normal input command\\%
			\input{testRectangle.tikz}%
		\item Use includegraphics with file ending\\%
			\includegraphics{testRectangle.tikz}%
		\item Use includegraphics without file ending\\%
			\includegraphics{testRectangle}%
		\item Use includegraphics with scaling to the column's width\\%
			\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{testRectangle}%
		\item Use includegraphics with scaling to a dimension\\%
			\includegraphics[width=5cm]{testRectangle}%
		\item Use includegraphics with scaling while having column width already\\%
			\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{linewidth}%
		\item Use includegraphics with jpg\\%
			\includegraphics{example-grid-100x100bp.jpg}%
		\item Use includegraphics with pdf\\%
			\includegraphics{example-grid-100x100bp.pdf}%
		\item Use includegraphics with png\\%
			\includegraphics{example-grid-100x100bp.png}%
% 		\item Use includegraphics with eps%
% 			\includegraphics{example-grid-100x100bp.eps}%
		\item Use includegraphics with pdf and scaling\\%
			\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{example-grid-100x100bp.pdf}%
		\item Use includegraphics with column width\\%
			\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example-grid-100x100bp.jpg}%
		\item Use \texttt{input} with pgfplots\\%
			\input{pgfplots-test.tikz}%
		\item Input a 2D pgfplots\\
			\input{testgraphic2D.tikz}%
		\item Use pgfplots without optional parameter\\%
			\includegraphics{pgfplots-test}%
		\item Use pgfplots with given width and height\\%
			\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,height=0.3\linewidth]{pgfplots-test}%
		\item Use includegraphics with only a node\\%
			\includegraphics{testNode.tikz}%
% 		\item Use includegraphics with scaling only a node results in an error\\%
% 			\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{testNode.tikz}%
		\item Use includegraphics with a two dimensional plot\\%
			\includegraphics{testgraphic2D.tikz}%
		\item Use includegraphics with a scaled two dimensional plot with line width and an axis ratio of 1\\%

		\item Use includegraphics with a scaled two dimensional plot with given height and an axis ratio of 0.5 again\\%
			\includegraphics[height=\linewidth,axisratio=0.5]{testgraphic2D.tikz}%
		\item Use includegraphics with a scaled two dimensional plot with line width and a default axis ratio\\%
